Repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solvers.

## 2021
For [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) I'm setting myself the challenge to solve the puzzles in Rust (probably I will solve each puzzle in Python and then try to realize it in Rust).

## 2020
In [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), I solved the majority of puzzles in Python. When I come around to clean up the code a bit, I will upload it as well.

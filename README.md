# advent_of_code
Repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solvers.

## 2021
For [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) I'm setting myself the challenge to solve the puzzles in Rust (probably I will solve each puzzle in Python fist and then try to realize it in Rust...).

## 2020
In [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), I solved the majority of puzzles in Python. When I come around to clean up the code a bit, I will upload it as well (3/25).

### Run Instructions
* Create a virtual environment (`python3 -m venv .venv`) and activate it (`source .venv/bin/activate`)
* Install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
* Get your personalized *input* from Advent of Code and place it in the directory of the respective day
* From the directory `2020` execute `python3 -m day<nr>.solve`
